    <h1> Bringing the Classroom to You!</h1>
    <p>
        Our student learnbook makes learning even easier, where students can complete their studies anywhere, anytime and on multiple devices.

        Backed by Moodle and E-Creators, students will have around the clock access to their learning platform. Here they can access all learning materials, supporting videos and still receive the same level of dedicated trainer support just like in the classroom.
    </p>
    <h3>How will E-learning benefit me as a student?</h3>
    <p>
        Online learning may not be for everyone, but here are a few reasons why it may be ideal for you.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Flexible & convenient: You can complete your studies anywhere, at any time and on multiple devices. Perfect for fitting your studies in around existing commitments.
        </li>
        <li>
            Specialised trainer support: Direct contact with a dedicated trainer will be on-hand to help support, motivate and keep you on track. You may contact your trainer via phone, email, or arrange a teleconference session.
        </li>
        <li>
            Learning is individual: Studying in large groups is not for everyone. Studying online removes the ‘peer pressure’ of classroom study.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is easy to use.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Duration of Training</h4>
    <p>
        The trainig duration of each course usually takes 6 to 12 months, and sometimes, 24 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        Individual training plans will be developed to ensure successful completion of the course taking into consideration the needs and resources of each student.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Training Mode of Delivery
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Classroom Learning: Our Training Centre is located at Homebush with small classes for dedicated and individualised support. Some students participate in a traineeship by attending classes and combine this with employment based learning. ATC regularly conduct classes from other sites where possible.</li>
        <li>Online or Distance Learning: ATC utilise an online assessment platform providing students with learning material, assessments and regular support from your assessor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Fees and Charges</h4>
    <p>Most fees are government subsidised, however, you must be eligible for this matter. Contact us to find out about your eligibility for government subsidies and fees</p>
    <h4>Units</h4>
    <p>Total number of units = 12 with 6 core subjects and 6 electives. Core units ad elective units are listed below in the specific study.</p>
